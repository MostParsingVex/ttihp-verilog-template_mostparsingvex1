## How it works

A 50 MHz clock is prescaled down to 1 MHz. This prescaled clock is then further prescaled around 1 kHz and ANDed to the 1 MHz clock, depending on the state of the input. 

## How to test

One hot in the inputs and watch the outputs wiggle.

## External hardware

Inputs might be connected to buttons. Outputs might be observed on a logic analyzer or oscilloscope.
